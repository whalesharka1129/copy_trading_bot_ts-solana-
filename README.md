## Copy trading bot

A copy trading bot on Solana automatically tracks and mimics the trades of a specific trader's wallet. It monitors the trader's transactions (like buying or selling tokens) and automatically executes the same actions in your wallet in real-time. The bot allows you to follow experienced traders without manually managing trades, copying their buys and sells on the Solana blockchain.

Supported on Raydium, Jupiter and Pumpfun 

### Bot Features

- Track Token Swaps: Continuously monitors every token swap on the Solana network to identify the best opportunities.
- Trade Across Multiple DEXs: Swap tokens on any supported decentralized exchange according to your preferences.
- Automatic Trades: Let the bot automatically buy and sell based on your customized strategy, so you donâ€™t have to lift a finger.
- Customizable Trading Strategy: Tailor your own trading approach to fit your risk tolerance and goals. 
- Multi-Wallet Support: Set up and manage multiple wallets, executing trades on each at the same time.

### Performance Analysis: Copy Trading Bot Response Time Evaluation
Our copy trading bot has undergone comprehensive performance testing using both standard RPC and gRPC protocols. Based on our benchmarking results, we found that while our bot performs adequately, its response times are notably slower compared to industry-standard trading systems that utilize optimized RPC and gRPC services.
For professional trading operations that require ultra-low latency, we recommend implementing performance enhancements to match the speed of high-performance trading infrastructure. Specifically, our tests indicate that a well-optimized RPC/gRPC implementation could significantly reduce latency and improve execution times for copy trading operations.
Key observations:

1. Current response times are higher than desired for real-time trading
2. There's measurable performance gap compared to optimized RPC/gRPC services
3. Potential for significant speed improvements through optimization
