## Copy trading bot

A copy trading bot on Solana automatically tracks and mimics the trades of a specific trader's wallet. It monitors the trader's transactions (like buying or selling tokens) and automatically executes the same actions in your wallet in real-time. The bot allows you to follow experienced traders without manually managing trades, copying their buys and sells on the Solana blockchain.

Supported on Raydium, Jupiter and Pumpfun

### Bot Features

- Track Token Swaps: Continuously monitors every token swap on the Solana network to identify the best opportunities.
- Trade Across Multiple DEXs: Swap tokens on any supported decentralized exchange according to your preferences.
- Automatic Trades: Let the bot automatically buy and sell based on your customized strategy, so you donâ€™t have to lift a finger.
- Customizable Trading Strategy: Tailor your own trading approach to fit your risk tolerance and goals.
- Multi-Wallet Support: Set up and manage multiple wallets, executing trades on each at the same time.
