## Copy trading bot

A copy trading bot on Solana automatically tracks and mimics the trades of a specific trader's wallet. It monitors the trader's transactions (like buying or selling tokens) and automatically executes the same actions in your wallet in real-time. The bot allows you to follow experienced traders without manually managing trades, copying their buys and sells on the Solana blockchain.
